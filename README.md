### Original code for Wu, Garushyants et al. "Synergistic anti-phage activity of bacterial immune systems"

#### **scripts**
Contain scripts to reproduce the analysis and vizualize data

Scripts *Ecoli26k_tree_phylogroups_defense_systems.R* and *Vizualize_phylogenetic_trees_orders.R* vizualize phylognetic trees and add data to them.

*Ecoli_defsystems_presence_by_phylogroup.R* allows to analyze immune systems content in E. coli phylogroups and also performs enrichment analysis.

*Pagel_calculate_sge_farm.R* is the main script to run the Pagel correlation test for the binary traits

*Pagel_vizualization_Ecoli.R* and *Pagel_vizualization_orders.R* calculate directionality of interactions for the significant results and vizualize the data for 26k E. coli dataset and order level datasets accordingly.

*Draw_trees_for_selected_pairs.R* vizualizes phylogenetic trees for selected pairs of immune systems.
